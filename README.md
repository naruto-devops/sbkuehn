My name is Shannon Kuehn (pronounced "Keen"). I am a not-so-typical technologist, as my roots are grounded in public speaking and writing. I was a Communication Studies major and English minor in college (University of Nebraska at Lincoln graduate - Go Big Red!). Prior to collegiate life, I participated in competitive high school speech tournaments. 

You might be wondering how I even became technical. I gravitated toward technology through music, by way of being a DJ and needing to record demos for club promoters. By taking the time to develop troubleshooting skills, I quickly found myself in jobs that started to push me toward deeper levels of technical skill. A self-described tinkerer, I worked with technical mentors and colleagues who helped me develop proficiencies in infrastructure. From my initial roots in help desk, to Windows systems administration, to VMware administration, to Exchange, to Exchange Online/Office 365, and finally Azure, I carefully combined the right levels of technical prowess to propel me into into my first role at Microsoft as a Cloud Solution Architect on the US National CSA Team. After helping customers for over 2 years, I moved into a Cloud Advocate role on the Enterprise Tools and Platform team, which rolls up to the broader Methods and Practices team. I focus on creating content and community outreach for the Azure VMware Solution as a way of helping IT pros feel comfortable with the Azure platform.
